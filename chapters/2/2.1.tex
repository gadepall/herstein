	\item Determine if the following sets G with the operation indicated form a group. If not, point out which of the group axioms fail. 

	\item  $G$ = set of all integers, $a * b = a-b$. 
	\item  $G$ = set of all integers, $a * b = a + b + ab $
	\item  $G$ = set of nonnegative integers, $a * b = a + b$. 
	\item  $G$ = set of all rational numbers $\ne  -1, a * b = a + b + ab $.
	\item  $G$ = set of all rational numbers with denominator divisible by 5 (written so that numerator and denominator are relatively prime), $a * b = a + b$.
	\item  $G$ a set having more than one element, $a * b = a \forall a, b \in G$.
